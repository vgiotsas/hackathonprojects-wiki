# Nokia Challenges

## On demand wireless service placement
### Description
find the proper location of a WiFi access point in a radio environment with interference. One remotely controled vehicle can be used for the placement and a second one for measurements. This mimics the radio head placement and coverage measurement with drones. The teams should be able to make an algorithm which measures the radio conditions and make decision on WiFi access point location accordingly in order to achieve the best possible throughput performance on a WiFi channel. 
### Challenge
People mobility, especially in case of ad hoc events (concerts, sports, etc.) causes demand peak in ceratain locations. Extra service limited in time and location is needed to keep user statisfaction. Common approach is to place extra radio heads with drones for the time of the event. A special challenge is how to place the radio heads (without prior coverage planning) in an optimal way from coverage PoV. Existing radio heads might create interference, whereas measurements and placing has to be done on the location within short time, almost in an ad hoc manner.
### Given asset
Wifi access point with open wrt and measurement device (Android)
Remote controlled vehicles with programable API
### Required competence
Linux programming
Android programming
## Extandable object recognition system
### Description
Object recognition algorithm to be developed for a specific type of yet unknown object. 
### Challenge
Trained object recognition algorithms are commonly available with the predefined list of recognized objects. Providing simple/efficient means to extend the list of recognized objects with limited training data is the challenge.
### Given asset
Laptop with trained object recognition algorithm
tensorflow API 
### Required competence
Linux
Python
Tensorflow

### Description

### Challenge
The quantification of the impact of  a Tweet, e.g., reach (re-tweets/time window, number of recipients)
### Given asset
Laptop
Internet connection
### Required competence
javascript
web api
analytics
