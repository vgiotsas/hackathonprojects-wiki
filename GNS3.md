# GNS3 Challenges

## Network simulator/emulator in Cloud based on Containers

In some point we are planning to develop GNS3 version fully in Cloud based on Containers where is possible to simulate large topologies, similar to the idea presented by Microsoft in CrystalNet:

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/p599-liu.pdf

Project steps:
* evaluate technical possibility to achieve it,
* Minimal Value Product - running topology on different containers/machines which can be scaled up on demand
* Performance testing how this network behaves.

This prototype will become base for gns3-cloud and will be licensed on GPLv3. 

Required skills:
* Python
* Docker/Containers
* Network engineering
* *Cloud experience

## WebUI development

In June weâ€™re releasing first version of [WebUI](https://github.com/GNS3/gns3-web-ui) where user is able to browse his GNS3 projects and view topology.

The proposed challenge is to extend WebUI for user interactions and devices configuration.

Required skills:
* Angular/TypeScript/JavaScript

## Extending GNS3 

Our users submit ideas for desired features in GNS3, we have basically two list of them:

* [GNS3 GUI](https://github.com/GNS3/gns3-gui/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AEnhancement)
* [GNS3 Server](https://github.com/GNS3/gns3-server/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AEnhancement)

Hackathon participants may take one/many from these lists or suggest what they would like to see in GNS3/what is helpful for them/what they is funny for them to develop.

Required skills:
* Any known by participants
