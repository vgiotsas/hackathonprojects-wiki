# Selection of similar Vantage Points

INSPIRE (Internet Security Privacy and Intelligence Research Group) - www.inspire.edu.gr

## Description

Large scale Internet measurements are known to be costly in terms of computer resources, effort and time. Our goal in this project is to alleviate this impediment by proposing and applying a sophisticated methodology to cluster similar vantage points (VPs). Similar VPs means that they observe similar IP paths; by selecting representative VPs per similarity cluster we can minimize the total overhead of measurement campaigns.

## P​roject Steps

* Collection of traceroute paths
* Propose similarity methodology
* Similarity approach evaluation
* REST API deployment

## Required Skills

* Traceroute data analysis
* Python
* RIPE Atlas API
* Django
